# Flappy Bird Game

## Overview
A simple clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, built with Python and Pygame. The game features a flying bird that must navigate between pipes by avoiding collisions, along with a scoring system, and user interface elements like a "Play Again" button after game-over.

## Features

- Bird Movement: Control the bird by tapping spacebar to make it fly.
- Pipe Generation: Randomly placed pipes that scroll across the screen.
- Collision Detection: Game-over when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
- Scoring: Earn points by successfully passing through pipes.
- Restart Button: Try again after the game ends by clicking the "Play" button.
- Customizable: Easily adjustable settings like pipe speed, gravity, and jump height.

## Controls

- Spacebar: Makes the bird "jump" (fly upwards).
- Q: Quit the game.

## Usage

Once the game starts, your objective is to navigate the bird through the gaps between pipes without colliding. If you crash into a pipe or the ground, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing the "Play Again" button.

## Installation
